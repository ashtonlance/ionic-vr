It includes enhancements to resolve some of the issues surrounding XHR requests, along with some DOM exception issues. Ionic is working with the Cordova team\nto fully test these changes with the eventual goal of merging the updates into the official Cordova plugin. After the beta testing period, our hope is to make the WKWebView plugin an Ionic default so all users can easily take advantage of this plugin's improved performance over UIWebView.\n\nThis plugin only supports iOS 9 and above and will fall back to UIWebView on iOS 8.\n\nThe WKWebView plugin is only used by iOS, so ensure the `cordova-ios` platform is installed. Additionly, the `cordova-ios` platform version must be `4.0` or greater.\n\nInstallation Instructions\n-------------------\n\nEnsure the latest Cordova CLI is installed:  (Sudo may be required)\n\n```\nnpm install cordova -g\n```\n\nEnsure the `ios` platform has been added:\n\n```\nionic cordova platform ls\n```\n\nIf the iOS platform is not listed, run the following command:\n\n```\nionic cordova platform add ios\n```\n\nIf the iOS platform is installed but the version is < `4.x`, run the following commands:\n\n```\nionic cordova platform update ios\nionic cordova plugin save           # creates backup of existing plugins\nrm -rf ./plugins            # delete plugins directory\nionic cordova prepare               # re-install plugins compatible with cordova-ios 4.x\n```\n\nInstall the WKWebViewPlugin:\n\n```\nionic cordova plugin add https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine.git --save\n```\n\n**Note:** \n\nIf you already had [apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine) install make sure that is removed before using this version.\n\n```\nionic cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine\n```\n\n\nBuild the platform:\n\n```\nionic cordova prepare\n```\n\nTest the app on an iOS 9 or 10 device:\n\n```\nionic cordova run ios\n```\n\nAn easy way to verify that WKWebView has been installed on iOS is to check if `window.indexedDB` exists.  For example:\n\n```\nif (window.indexedDB) {\n   console.log(\"I'm in WKWebView!\");\n} else {\n   console.log(\"I'm in UIWebView\");\n}\n```\n\nRequired Permissions\n-------------------\nWKWebView may not fully launch (the deviceready event may not fire) unless if the following is included in config.xml:\n#### config.xml\n```\n<allow-navigation href=\"http://localhost:8080/*\"/>\n<feature name=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\">\n  <param name=\"ios-package\" value=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\" />\n</feature>\n\n<preference name=\"CordovaWebViewEngine\" value=\"CDVWKWebViewEngine\" />\n```\n\nApplication Transport Security (ATS) in iOS 9\n-----------\n\nThe next released version of the [cordova-cli 5.4.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova) will support automatic conversion of the [&lt;access&gt;](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide/appdev/whitelist/index.html) tags in config.xml to Application Transport Security [ATS](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) directives. Upgrade to the version 5.4.0 to use this new functionality.\n\nApple Issues\n-------\n\nThe `AllowInlineMediaPlayback` preference will not work because of this [Apple bug](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6673091526656000). This bug [has been fixed](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-11452) in [iOS 10](https://twitter.com/shazron/status/745546355796389889).\n\nLimitations\n--------\n\nThere are several [known issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20wkwebview-known-issues) with the official Cordova WKWebView plugin. The Ionic team thinks we have resolved several of the major issues. Please [let us know](https://github.com/driftyco/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/issues) if something isn't working as expected.\n",
